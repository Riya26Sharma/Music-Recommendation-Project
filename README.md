# Data-Driven Insights for Music Success

## Introduction
In todayâ€™s creator-driven economy, data-driven insights are crucial for identifying what drives success in the music industry. Collaboration among artists is common, and music and short-form videos now synergize to create greater value. This repository documents my project aimed at investigating the factors contributing to song success beyond traditional metrics.

## Objective
The aim of my project is to investigate and map the factors that make a song successful beyond the traditional metrics in music. Through my analysis, I aim to visualize the effect of these factors to potentially aid creative music decisions through the power of data-driven decision-making.

## Data Collection
- I collected data from Kaggle, covering songs from 1942 to 2021, including various genres and song features such as popularity, energy, danceability, and more.
- Additionally, I obtained real-time data for songs released in 2022 using the Spotipy library, focusing on the same song features for analysis.

## Analysis
My analysis involves exploring various song features and their impact on the success of a track. I delve into factors such as acousticness, danceability, liveness, loudness, speechiness, valence, and duration, providing insights into their significance in determining a song's popularity and virality.

## Conclusions
- Artist followers and popularity do not strongly correlate with success.
- Genre and individual musical attributes have minimal impact on song success, allowing artists to explore creativity freely.
- Market demand favors shorter track durations (140-210 seconds) for maximum success and streams.
- Collaboration with other artists significantly impacts popularity, with collaborative tracks exhibiting higher thresholds for success.

## Recommendations
- I recommend focusing on collaboration with new artists to increase track virality.
- Producing shorter duration tracks aligned with market demand is advisable.
- Exploring creative freedom to produce engaging music content is essential.
