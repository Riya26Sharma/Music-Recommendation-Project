# Data-Driven Insights for Music Success

## Introduction
In todayâ€™s creator-driven economy, data-driven insights are crucial for identifying what drives success in the music industry. Collaboration among artists is common, and music and short-form videos now synergize to create greater value. ABOT Wall Consultants specializes in market research for the music industry, providing insights to aid creative music decisions. This repository documents our project aimed at investigating the factors contributing to song success beyond traditional metrics.

## Objective
The aim of this project is to investigate and map the factors that make a song successful beyond the traditional metrics in music. Through our analysis, we aim to visualize the effect of these factors to potentially aid creative music decisions through the power of data-driven decision-making.

## Data Collection
- We collected data from Kaggle, covering songs from 1942 to 2021, including various genres and song features such as popularity, energy, danceability, and more.
- Additionally, we obtained real-time data for songs released in 2022 using the Spotipy library, focusing on the same song features for analysis.

## Analysis
Our analysis involves exploring various song features and their impact on the success of a track. We delve into factors such as acousticness, danceability, liveness, loudness, speechiness, valence, and duration, providing insights into their significance in determining a song's popularity and virality.

## Conclusions
- Artist followers and popularity do not strongly correlate with success.
- Genre and individual musical attributes have minimal impact on song success, allowing artists to explore creativity freely.
- Market demand favors shorter track durations (140-210 seconds) for maximum success and streams.
- Collaboration with other artists significantly impacts popularity, with collaborative tracks exhibiting higher thresholds for success.

## Recommendations
- Focus on collaboration with new artists to increase track virality.
- Produce shorter duration tracks aligned with market demand.
- Explore creative freedom to produce engaging music content.
